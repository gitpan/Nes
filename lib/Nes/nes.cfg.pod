=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Nes;

    my $config = $nes->{'CFG'};

    my $var1   = $config->{'myscript_var1'};
    my $objdir = $config->{'obj_top_dir'};

Access by template:

    {: * cfg_myscript_var1 :}
    {: * cfg_obj_top_dir :}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The .nes.cfg is placed in the directory where you installed your 
nhtml templates, it overwrites Setting and the plugins configuration.
Level rises, until the root directory of the Web, to read .nes.cfg files.  

private_key value that is used to encrypt data, if not changed the script

=head1 Use in your script

You can use .nes.cfg to add configuration variables to your script. We 
recommend using a notation that clearly distinguishes Nes variables, 
for example using prefixes the name of your application, 
.nes.cfg content:
    
    private_key   = pass
    myscript_var1 = 50

You can access these variables from the nhtml template as:

    {: * cfg_myscript_var1 :}

And from Perl:

    use Nes;
    my $nes    = Nes::Singleton->new();
    my $config = $nes->{'CFG'};
    my $var1   = $config->{'myscript_var1'};

=head1 Perl syntax in the value

In the predefined variables, Nes detects the data type automatically:

    # Is scalar
    tmp_dir = /tmp/nes

    # It is an array, separated by commas
    auto_load_plugin_top_first = plugin1.pl, plugin1.pl

If we define our own variables with a particular data type:

    # Scalar, using Perl syntax in the value.
    myscript_var1 $= 'scalar'

    # Hash
    myscript_var2 %= ( 'name' => 'Jason', 'email' => 'jason\@example.com' )

    # Array
    myscript_var3 @= ( 'one', 'two', 'three' )

We may also use Perl syntax for variables in the predefined value,
taking care not to change the type:

    # scalar
    tmp_dir $= '/tmp/nes'

    # It is an array, ERROR
    tmp_dir %= '/tmp/nes'

    # Array, separated by commas
    auto_load_plugin_top_first = plugin1.pl, plugin2.pl

    # Array, Perl syntax
    auto_load_plugin_top_first @= ( 'plugin1.pl', 'plugin2.pl' )

In the predefined variables are all scalar except those allowed 
are comma-separated arrays. If we arrays can be useful if one 
of the values has a coma, or the scalar to define a space:

    # we can not take as value a space like this:
    myscript_var1 = ' '  <- error, value is the literal, including quotation 
    myscript_var1 =      <- error, no value

    # to give as value a space can do so:
    myscript_var1 $= ' ' 

    # Array, the name includes a comma
    auto_load_plugin_top_first = plugin,1.pl, plugin,2.pl <- error

    # Array, Perl syntax the name includes a comma
    auto_load_plugin_top_first @= ( 'plugin,1.pl', 'plugin,2.pl' )

Each variable can only occupy one line.
