<h3>What is not Nes</h3> 
<p>
It is not a Perl's functions library. (Although it may be used as such)
<br>
It is not a programming language. (Although it seems)
</p>
<h3>What is Nes</h3>
<p>
It is a system of templates and replacement of variables for the Web and Perl. It manages web components,
 pages, URLs, graphics, HTML tags, as objects.
</p>
<p>
It is a way to separate Perl code and HTML. The HTML Tags are replaced by variables created in Perl.
</p>
<h3>Objetives</h3>
<p>
Separation between Perl code and HTML.
</p>
<p>
Simplicity, not many things to learn about Perl. Objetive is that Nes has not more of twenty Tags, and <b>only one object</b> to created in Perl.
</p>
<p>
Reuse Code, encapsulating HTML with your Perl code.
</p>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>
CGI distinguishes scripts running on server side and scripts running on client side. For a Web server is not same a file called "file.cgi" and other called "file.html"
</p>
<p>
This distinction is good for a Web Server, but not for a Web user, who know nothing about that.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes we access to information in this way:
<pre>
http://domain.com/file.cgi
</pre>
And other times we useÂ­:
<pre>
    
http://domain.com/file.html
</pre>
</p>
<p>
If you ask to Web Server, CGI is the reason, and if you ask to an user, may be that you will create a problem to he.
</p>
<p>
With simple instructions into file "htaccess" we can create a handler and we can run the perl scripts with the extension that we want.
</p>
<p>
For Nes we are created extension <i>nhtml</i> (nes-html), htmaccess file seens as follow:
</p>
<pre>
AddHandler perl-nes .nhtml
AddHandler perl-nes .nhtm
Action perl-nes /nes/dispatch.cgi
</pre>
<p>
Well and, what is the way to know the script to run for a certain html file?
</p>
<p>
Nes uses next Tag to be included at the fist line of HTML file:
<pre>
&#123;: NES 0.4 ('file.cgi') :&#125;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
  ... 
</pre>
</p>
<p>
"dispatch.cgi" will launch "file.cgi", but...
</p>
<p>
What is required on "file.cgi" to put things on "file.nhtml"?
</p>
<p>
If we put nothing Nes will launch thew file as a HTML,
 but for the other cases we only need five simple lines of Perl code:
<pre>
# fundamental :-)
use Nes;

# Create a objet of class Singleton.
my $nes = Nes::Singleton->new('file.nhtml');

# variable to store data which we will show on HTML
my $nes_tags = {};

# data to be send to HTML output
$nes_tags->{'variable'} = 'Things to say to world';

# sending data to HTML output
$nes->out(%$nes_tags);
</pre>
</p>
<p>
How show we this variable on file.nhtml?
</p>
<p>
With this Tag Nes:
<pre>
&#123;: NES 0.4 ('file.cgi') :&#125;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Nes sample/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
   &#123;: $ variable :&#125;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<p>
doing <i>http://domain.com/file.nhtml</i> we will have:
</p>
<pre>   
Things to say to world
</pre>
<br>
<br>
